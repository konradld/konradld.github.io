This paper develops a framework for quantifying "Growth-at-Risk" by explicitly modeling time-varying skewness in the conditional distribution of economic growth. While existing approaches focus on quantile predictions, we show that incorporating skewness directly into the mean specification provides additional insights into downside macroeconomic risks. The methodology combines Bayesian methods with extreme value theory to assess tail risks to economic growth. Applications to business cycle analysis and macroprudential policy evaluation demonstrate the importance of accounting for asymmetric risks in growth forecasting.
