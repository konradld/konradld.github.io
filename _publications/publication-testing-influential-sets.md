This paper introduces a rigorous statistical framework for testing whether specific subsets of observations exert disproportionate influence on econometric estimates. Building on robust statistics and influence diagnostics, we develop formal hypothesis tests that can detect when particular groups of observations systematically affect model parameters and inference. The methodology is particularly relevant for detecting structural breaks, outliers, and regime changes in economic data.
