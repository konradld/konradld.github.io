This paper presents BISAM, a comprehensive R package for implementing Bayesian Indicator Saturated Models. Indicator saturation is a powerful approach for detecting outliers, structural breaks, and model misspecification by adding impulse indicator variables to regression models. We extend this methodology to a Bayesian framework, allowing for formal uncertainty quantification and coherent treatment of multiple potential breaks. The package provides efficient algorithms for high-dimensional model selection and includes tools for visualization, diagnostic checking, and inference. Applications demonstrate the package's utility across various econometric contexts including time series analysis, panel data, and anomaly detection.
