This paper introduces a new class of prior distributions for Bayesian inference that incorporates moment restrictions in an approximately exact manner. The methodology bridges the gap between moment-based econometric methods and Bayesian approaches, allowing researchers to flexibly impose economic theory through moment conditions while maintaining the computational advantages of modern Bayesian methods. Applications demonstrate improved inference in structural economic models where theory provides natural moment restrictions.
