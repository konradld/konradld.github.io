This paper advances the theory of influence diagnostics by developing methods to identify not just whether influential sets exist, but which sets are most influential. The methodology combines ideas from robust statistics, multiple testing procedures, and model selection to systematically rank and test different potential influential subsets. Applications include outlier detection, anomaly identification, and model diagnostics in econometric analysis.
