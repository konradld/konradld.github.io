I am a PhD Candidate at the [Vienna University of Economics and Business](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/).

My research interests are *econometric robustness* and *anomaly detection* in economic data as well as *economic risk* and modelling *dependency structures*. 

I am currently most engaged with theoretical work in the fields of machine learning and Bayesian statistics with applications to environmental and macro economics.

You can find a PDF version of my CV [here](files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf). Feel free to contact me via [lucas.konrad@wu.ac.at](mailto:lucas.konrad@wu.ac.at).
