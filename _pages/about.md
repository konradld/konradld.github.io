I am a PhD Candidate at the [Vienna University of Economics and Business](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/).

My research interests are econometric robustness and anomaly detection in economic data as well as economic risk. 

I am currently most engaged with theoretical work in the fields of machine learning and Bayesian statistics with applications to environmental and macro economics.

You can find my CV [here](files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf). Feel free to contact me via [mail](mailto:lucas.konrad@wu.ac.at).
