This introductory undergraduate course in econometrics provides students with the fundamental tools for empirical economic analysis. The course covers the classical linear regression model, including simple and multiple regression, interpretation of coefficients, goodness-of-fit measures, and statistical inference. Students learn to estimate and interpret economic relationships, test hypotheses, and understand the assumptions underlying econometric models. Practical applications focus on real-world economic problems using statistical software, enabling students to conduct their own empirical research. The course emphasizes both theoretical foundations and hands-on data analysis skills essential for applied economics.
