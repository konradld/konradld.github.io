This advanced undergraduate econometrics course builds upon foundational knowledge to cover sophisticated econometric techniques for empirical research. Topics include uni- and multivariate time series analysis, panel data methods, instrumental variables estimation, limited dependent variable models, and generalized method of moments. Students explore econometric challenges such as endogeneity, heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation, and model specification issues. The course emphasizes modern econometric approaches used in applied economic research, with particular attention to causal inference and policy evaluation. Students engage with current empirical studies and develop the skills to critically evaluate and conduct advanced econometric analyses using software such as R, Matlab or Python.
