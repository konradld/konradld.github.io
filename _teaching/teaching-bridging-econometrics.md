This graduate-level bridging course provides essential econometric foundations for incoming master's and PhD students. The course covers fundamental statistical concepts, probability theory, and introductory econometric methods necessary for advanced graduate coursework. Topics include ordinary least squares estimation, hypothesis testing, asymptotic theory, and maximum likelihood estimation. Students develop both theoretical understanding and practical skills through a combination of lectures, problem sets, and computational exercises using statistical software such as R and Stata.
