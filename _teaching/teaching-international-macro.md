This undergraduate course examines macroeconomic theory and policy in an international context. Students explore key topics including balance of payments, exchange rate determination, international capital flows, and monetary and fiscal policy in closed and open economies. The course covers foundational models such as the IS-LM model, the Mundell-Fleming framework, purchasing power parity, and interest rate parity conditions. Contemporary issues such as currency crises, international financial integration, global imbalances, and the role of international institutions (IMF, World Bank) are analyzed through both theoretical and empirical lenses. Students develop a theoretical understanding of how economies interact in the global system and how international linkages affect domestic macroeconomic outcomes and policy effectiveness.
