This paper develops a novel methodology for evaluating REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) programs by estimating counterfactual deforestation rates using random forest algorithms. A key challenge in assessing conservation programs is determining what would have happened in the absence of intervention. We combine machine learning techniques with causal inference methods to construct credible counterfactuals for forest protection policies. The approach accounts for spatial dependencies, environmental heterogeneity, and selection into treatment. Applications to real-world REDD+ projects demonstrate the importance of proper counterfactual estimation for policy evaluation and carbon credit certification.
