This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in panel data econometrics: detecting structural breaks when the time series dimension is short. Traditional break detection methods require long time series, limiting their applicability to many panel datasets with limited temporal observations but rich cross-sectional information. We develop a Bayesian indicator saturation approach that pools information across panel units while allowing for heterogeneous break patterns. The methodology is particularly relevant for analyzing policy interventions, economic crises, and institutional changes in cross-country or firm-level panels. Monte Carlo simulations and empirical applications demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in short-T panels.
